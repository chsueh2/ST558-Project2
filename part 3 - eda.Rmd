## Summarizations

> You should produce some basic (but meaningful) summary statistics and plots about the training data you
are working with (especially as it relates to your response).
>
> As you will automate this same analysis across other data, you canâ€™t describe the trends you see in the graph (unless you want to try to automate that!). You should describe what to look for in the summary statistics/plots to help the reader understand the summary or graph. Ex: A scatter plot with the number of shares on the y-axis and the positive word rate on the x-axis is created:
>
> 'We can inspect the trend of shares as a function of the positive word rate. If the points show an upward trend, then articles with more positive words tend to be shared more often. If we see a negative trend then articles with more positive words tend to be shared less often.'
>
> Each group member is responsible for producing some summary statistics (means, sds, contingency tables, etc.) and for producing at least three graphs (each) of the data.
