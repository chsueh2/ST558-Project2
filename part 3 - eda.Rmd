## Summarizations

> You should produce some basic (but meaningful) summary statistics and plots about the training data you
are working with (especially as it relates to your response).
>
> As you will automate this same analysis across other data, you can’t describe the trends you see in the graph (unless you want to try to automate that!). You should describe what to look for in the summary statistics/plots to help the reader understand the summary or graph. Ex: A scatter plot with the number of shares on the y-axis and the positive word rate on the x-axis is created:
>
> 'We can inspect the trend of shares as a function of the positive word rate. If the points show an upward trend, then articles with more positive words tend to be shared more often. If we see a negative trend then articles with more positive words tend to be shared less often.'
>
> Each group member is responsible for producing some summary statistics (means, sds, contingency tables, etc.) and for producing at least three graphs (each) of the data.


"part 2 - data.Rmd"


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::knit("part 2 - data.Rmd", output = tempfile())
```



## Start here...

```{r}
# check balance - compare ecdf of train and test sets
plot(ecdf(df_train$shares), col = "blue", main = "Empirical Cumulative Distribution", xlab = "shares")
plot(ecdf(df_test$shares), col = "red", add = T)
```


```{r}
#I use A in titles to denote the channel type.
table(df_train$channel)
A<- "lifestyle"
#channel <- "lifestyle"          

# subset by channel
df_train_x <- df_train %>% filter(channel == A)
df_train_x
df_test_x <- df_test %>% filter(channel == A)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

After we have filtered our data for one channel, lets summarize all of the data. The table below gives us the sample size (N), mean (Mean), standard deviation (Std. Dev.), minimum (Min), 25th percentile (Pctl. 25), 75th percentile (Pctl. 75), and maximum (Max).

```{r 8:29_7_7_2022}

library(vtable)
st(df_train_x)
```

Next, lets learn more about our response variable: `shares`. Lets do a 5-number summary. It will show the minimum (Min.), first quartile (1st Qu.), median (Median), mean (Mean), third quartile (3rd Qu.), and maximum (Max.). This will help us get an idea about the overall spread of the `shares` data.

```{r 8:15_7_8_2022}
nrow(df_train_x)
summary(df_train_x$shares)
```

Next, lets plot a histogram of the `shares` data so that we can visually see it's distribution. For example, we can determine if the distribution of `shares` is symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right.

```{r 8:21_7_8_2022}
n=nrow(df_train_x)
K = round(1 + 3.322 * log10(n),digits = 0) #find best number of bins using Sturge’s Rule
g <- ggplot(df_train_x, aes(x = shares))
g + geom_histogram(bins=K) +
  labs(title = paste0("Histogram: Distribution of Shares for ",A),y="Frequency",x="Shares")
```

Now, let's make a one-way contingency table to look at the total number of articles for every quantity of shares. We will be able to see if there were a lot of articles with a small number of shares or if there were a lot of articles with a large number of shares. 

```{r 8:40_7_8_2022}
table(df_train_x$shares)
```

Next, we'll create a box plot. Before we do that, let's make a binary version of the `shares` data. Using the mean of the `shares` data, we will give entries with a number of shares >= the mean a 1 and the rest a 0. This plot will show if the majority of shares is greater than or less than the mean of the shares. If it's larger than the mean, the box plot over the 1 should be larger and more spread out than the one over the 0.

```{r 8:49_7_8_2022}
library(tidyverse)
binary <- function(S){
if(S>=mean(df_train_x$shares)){
A<-1
return(A)
}
if(S<mean(df_train_x$shares)){
A<-0
return(A)
}
}

boxplot_data_df_train_x <- df_train_x
boxplot_data_df_train_x$binary_shares <- as.numeric(sapply(df_train_x$shares, FUN=binary))
boxplot_data_df_train_x %>% select(binary_shares, shares, everything())

g <- ggplot(boxplot_data_df_train_x, aes(x = factor(binary_shares), y = shares))
g + geom_boxplot(fill = "grey") +
  labs(x="Number of Shares (0: < mean of shares, 1: >= mean of shares)",
       title=paste0("Boxplot: Are Number of Shares in ",A," Greater than the Mean?"),
       y="Count")
```

Now, let's summarize the rest of the numeric variables (i.e., not `channel`,`weekday`,`is_weekend` because they're factors). This will give the 5-number summary for all of the numeric variables in our data set. This can help us understand the distribution of each variable.

```{r 9:08_7_8_2022}
summary_df_train_x <- df_train_x
summary_df_train_x = subset(summary_df_train_x, select = -c(channel,weekday,is_weekend))
summary(summary_df_train_x)
```

We can also visually inspect the distribution of each variable by making a histogram for each. We can look at each variable and see if it has a symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right distribution.

```{r 9:18_7_8_2022}
library(Hmisc)
hist.data.frame(summary_df_train_x,mtitl=paste0("Histograms for all Numeric Variabes in ",A))
```

Now, we will make a correlation plot comparing all of our numeric variables. When we do our modeling, we're looking for correlations that are greater than 0.75 and less than -0.75. In the plot below, we are looking for the bright red and bright blue sections.

```{r 8:10_7_7_2022}
correlation_plot_df_train_x <- df_train_x

#correlation_plot_df_train_x <- correlation_plot_df_train_x %>% filter(channel==A) 

correlation_plot_df_train_x <- dplyr::select_if(correlation_plot_df_train_x, is.numeric)

r <- cor(correlation_plot_df_train_x, use="complete.obs")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
ggcorrplot(r, 
            hc.order = TRUE, 
            type = "lower",
            tl.cex = 6,
           title = paste0("Correlation Plot for ",A))
```

Now, lets look at the three variables we left out: `channel`,`weekday`,`is_weekend`. We will start by making a summary table showing how many articles (or observations) where found for each channel (if the data set is sorted for a particular channel, you should only see counts for that channel), weekday, and the number of articles that were published during the weekend.

```{r 9:47_7_8_2022}
other_df_train_x <- df_train_x

other_df_train_x = subset(other_df_train_x, select = c(channel,weekday,is_weekend))

summary(other_df_train_x)

```

Next, we will make some contingency tables. The first one counts the number of articles that were published on a certain day of the week for each channel (again, if only one channel is selected, you will only see data for that channel). The second one counts the number of articles published on the weekend and not published on the weekend for each channel.

```{r 9:53_7_8_2022}
table(other_df_train_x$channel, other_df_train_x$weekday)

table(other_df_train_x$channel, other_df_train_x$is_weekend)
```

Below is a boxplot showing the number of shares for each weekday. It will help us understand if there are certain days of the week where articles get more or less shares.

```{r 10:00_7_8_2022}
other_df_train_x <- df_train_x

other_df_train_x = subset(other_df_train_x, select = c(channel,weekday,is_weekend,shares))

other_df_train_x %>% ggplot(aes(weekday, shares)) +
geom_boxplot() +
geom_jitter(width = 0.05) +
labs(
  title = paste0("Boxplots: Distribution of Shares in ",A," for Each Weekday"),
  x = "Weekday"
)
```
