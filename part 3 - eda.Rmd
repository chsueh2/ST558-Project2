## Summarizations

> You should produce some basic (but meaningful) summary statistics and plots about the training data you
are working with (especially as it relates to your response).
>
> As you will automate this same analysis across other data, you canâ€™t describe the trends you see in the graph (unless you want to try to automate that!). You should describe what to look for in the summary statistics/plots to help the reader understand the summary or graph. Ex: A scatter plot with the number of shares on the y-axis and the positive word rate on the x-axis is created:
>
> 'We can inspect the trend of shares as a function of the positive word rate. If the points show an upward trend, then articles with more positive words tend to be shared more often. If we see a negative trend then articles with more positive words tend to be shared less often.'
>
> Each group member is responsible for producing some summary statistics (means, sds, contingency tables, etc.) and for producing at least three graphs (each) of the data.


"part 2 - data.Rmd"


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::knit("part 2 - data.Rmd", output = tempfile())
```



## Start here...

```{r}
# check balance - compare ecdf of train and test sets
plot(ecdf(df_train$shares), col = "blue", main = "Empirical Cumulative Distribution", xlab = "shares")
plot(ecdf(df_test$shares), col = "red", add = T)
```


```{r}
table(df_train$channel)
channel <- "lifestyle"          

# subset by channel
df_train_x <- df_train %>% filter(channel == channel)
df_test_x <- df_test %>% filter(channel == channel)
```

```{r 8:29_7_7_2022}
#A summary table showing the sample size (N), mean, standard deviation (Std. Dev.), minimum (Min), 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum (Max)
library(vtable)
st(df_train_x)
```

```{r 7:31_7_7_2022}
A <- df_train_x %>%
  select(kw_avg_max,shares)

g <- ggplot(A, aes(x = kw_avg_max))
g + geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "red",
size = 2, binwidth = 30) +
  labs(x = "Best Keyword (Average Number of Shares)", title = "Distribution of Shares by Best Keyword", y="Number of Shares")
```

```{r 8:10_7_7_2022}
#we need to be able to cycle through the channels
#maybe something like this: A <- df_train_x %>% filter(channel==channel)
A <- df_train_x %>% filter(channel=="lifestyle") 

A <- dplyr::select_if(A, is.numeric)

r <- cor(A, use="complete.obs")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
ggcorrplot(r, 
            hc.order = TRUE, 
            type = "lower",
            tl.cex = 6)
```



```{r}
# quick summaries of numeric and categorical variables
skim(df_train_x)
```



```{r}
#mean(df_train_x$shares)
```


Form `r channel` news channel subset, we found the mean of `shares` is `r mean(df_train_x, na.rm)`.
